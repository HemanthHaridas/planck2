class BaseCalculator(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class (ABC) for implementing calculator classes for quantum chemistry calculations.

    This class defines the structure for creating calculators that can perform 
    Hartree-Fock (HF) and MÃ¸ller-Plesset second-order perturbation theory (MP2) calculations. 
    Derived classes must implement the `calculator` method to define specific computational workflows.

    Methods
    -------
    calculator():
        Abstract method that must be implemented in subclasses to perform 
        Hartree-Fock or MP2 calculations or their variations.

        Abstract method to perform quantum chemistry calculations.
        
        This method should be overridden by subclasses to include the specific
        logic for Hartree-Fock or MP2 calculations. The implementation should 
        handle the setup of necessary computational parameters and execute the 
        calculation workflow.
        
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If the method is not implemented in a subclass.
