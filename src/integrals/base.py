class Integral(ABC):
    """
    An abstract base class that defines the structure for integration-related operations
    involving shell pairs and integral evaluation.

    This class provides three abstract methods: `create_shellpairs`, `sort_shellpairs`, and `evaluate`.
    - `create_shellpairs` is meant to generate the necessary shell pairs for integration.
    - `sort_shellpairs` is intended to sort or organize the shell pairs for efficient evaluation.
    - `evaluate` is responsible for computing the integral based on the sorted shell pairs and returning
      the result as a list of floating-point values.

    Subclasses of this class should provide concrete implementations for these methods to define
    the specific behavior for creating shell pairs, sorting them, and evaluating the integral.

    Methods:
    --------
    create_shellpairs(self) -> None:
        Abstract method that creates the necessary shell pairs for integration.
        Subclasses should implement the logic to create the shell pairs based on the data or functions
        being integrated.

    sort_shellpairs(self) -> None:
        Abstract method that sorts or organizes the created shell pairs.
        Subclasses should implement the sorting logic to ensure that the shell pairs are in an appropriate
        order for the integral evaluation.

    evaluate(self) -> list[float]:
        Abstract method that evaluates the integral based on the sorted shell pairs and returns
        the result as a list of floating-point values.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def create_shellpairs(self) -> None:
        """
        Creates the necessary shell pairs for integration.

        This method should be implemented by subclasses to define how the shell pairs are created.
        Shell pairs represent the necessary combinations of data or functions that need to be integrated.
        
        Returns:
        --------
        None: This method does not return a value. It prepares the shell pairs for further processing.
        """
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def sort_shellpairs(self) -> None:
        """
        Sorts or organizes the shell pairs for efficient evaluation.

        This method should be implemented by subclasses to define how the shell pairs are sorted
        or organized. Sorting may be required to optimize the performance or to meet the integration
        requirements.
        
        Returns:
        --------
        None: This method does not return a value. It organizes the shell pairs in-place.

        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def evaluate(self) -> typing.Union[list[float],list[list[float]]]:
        """
        Evaluates the integral based on the sorted shell pairs and returns the result as a list of floats.

        This method should be implemented by subclasses to compute the value of the integral using the
        sorted shell pairs. The result should be returned as a list of floating-point values, which may represent
        multiple integral values or components depending on the integration method.

        Returns:
        --------
        list[float]: A list of floating-point values representing the result of the integral evaluation.
