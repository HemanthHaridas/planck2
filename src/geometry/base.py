    Abstract Base Class (ABC) for representing a molecule.

    This class serves as a blueprint for creating specific molecule implementations. 
    It requires subclasses to define the `geometry` method, which should describe 
    the geometric properties of the molecule, such as its spatial structure, coordinates, 
    or connectivity.

    Methods:
        geometry():
            Abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses to define 
            the geometric properties of the molecule.
