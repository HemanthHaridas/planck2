    Abstract Base Class (ABC) for representing a molecule.

    This class serves as a blueprint for creating specific molecule implementations. 
    It requires subclasses to define the `geometry` method, which should describe 
    the geometric properties of the molecule, such as its spatial structure, coordinates, 
    or connectivity.

    Methods:
        geometry():
            Abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses to define 
            the geometric properties of the molecule.

        This method should be implemented in subclasses to provide specific details
        about the molecule's geometry. The implementation can include attributes 
        such as atomic positions, bond lengths, angles, and molecular shape.

        Raises:
            NotImplementedError: If the method is not implemented in a subclass.
